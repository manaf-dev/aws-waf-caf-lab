Quick note on how I approached the lab:
- First drew the original on-prem setup from the description (2-tier).
- Went through each Well-Architected pillar one by one and tried to be honest about what’s actually bad right now.
- For CAF I applied the six perspectives and wrote what our company is realistically like (mid-size company, some IT people afraid of cloud, etc.).
- I researched for architectures for inference and redesigned the architecture trying to fix everything I complained about earlier.
- Used lucidchart because it’s free and simple with good shapes.

Took me about 5 hours total spread over my day and evening.
